# Project Todos

In this project we were supposed to build a todo list in React by using useDispatch and useSelector and useState hooks and we have learned how to use redux store, reducers and actions.

## The problem

I started to think about which components I would use for the project. I felt as usual that it was difficult to get started so I coded along with the lectures and made my best to understand everything I did. I made the code work after the lectures and then I added a header component and a no-data component. When I had achieved the blue goals I tried to implement a lottie-animtaion or an image which was going to show when the screen turned empty but that didn't work out. If I had more time I would have continue with that and search a bit more about how to make it work!
I had a huge problem with deploying the project to Netlify but succeeded at last.
